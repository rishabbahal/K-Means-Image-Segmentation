This assignment is submitted by:
Rishab Bahal
Purpose: Implement Image segmentation using K-Means algorithm.
Enter input filename:input/brain.pgm
Enter output filename:output/brain_segmented.pgm
Press '1' for coloured image, '0' for grayscale image: 0
Enter K:1
Error: K has to be greater than 2
Enter K:3
Maximum iterations: 25
If you want to enter initial points manually press '1' else '0': 1
Processing image, might take some time.
Enter x for center: 28
Enter y for center: 59
Enter x for center: 84
Enter y for center: 108
Enter x for center: 171
Enter y for center: 140
Iteration: 0
```

**_I am using ppm and pgm images, but you can use jpg and png as well._**
